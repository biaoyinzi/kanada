Kanada
======

A Java library to transliterate normal Kanji-mixed Japanese text into Hiragana, Katakana, or Romaji representation, just like KAKASHI library does.
The Kanada is also useful for text segmentation processing for further morphological analysis.

This is something I've written (ported from KAKASHI) more than a decade ago and hasn't been maintained since then.
I'm planning to refine the library so that it become more useful for Android app developers.
